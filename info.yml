    write_nodes:
        type: list
        description: "A list of dictionaries in which you define the ShotGrid Write nodes that
                     are supported in this configuration. Each dictionary entry needs to have
                     the following keys: 'name' - a descriptive name for this node. 'file_type' -
                     the file type to use for the renders (exr, cin, dpx etc). This will be
                     passed to the Nuke write node when rendering. 'settings' - configuration
                     settings for the given file type, as a dictionary. This too will be
                     passed to the write node when rendering. Next, you need two entries
                     named 'render_template' and 'publish_template'
                     - these control the locations where data is written to at various stages
                     of the workflow. These templates need to include the 'version' field
                     and can optionally include the fields 'name', 'width', 'height'
                     (which reflect the image resolution of the render) and 'output' (which
                     differenciates different write nodes). If you are doing stereo
                     rendering and want to use Nuke's %V flag, include an 'eye' field.
                     This will be replaced by %V in the paths when the ShotGrid Write node
                     computes them.  Finally, you need the templates 'proxy_render_template'
                     and 'proxy_publish_template' these have the same requirements as the regular
                     render and pubish templates but are used when rendering in proxy mode.  If
                     these are missing (set to null) then the regular templates will be used
                     instead."
